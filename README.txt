# fileTransfer
Project 2 for CS 372
Author: Luke Burris

How to compile all files:
	Run the command "make all"

How to clean up files (you shouldn't need this):
	Run the command "make clean"

Usage for ftclient:
	ftclient [serverName] [serverPort] [command (-l or -g)] [fileName (if command is -g)] [clientPort]

Usage for ftserver:
	ftserver [port]

Extra Credit:
	I implemented a username/password login for the server side. The username is "username" and the password is "password".
